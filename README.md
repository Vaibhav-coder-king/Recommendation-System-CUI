# Recommendation-System-CUI
A Python-based recommendation system that lets users search and explore movies, web series, anime, and K-dramas. It uses the OMDb API to fetch details like genre, rating, and plot, and provides genre-based suggestions from local CSV files. The system also updates the local database automatically with new titles.
